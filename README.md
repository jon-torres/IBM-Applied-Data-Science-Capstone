<h1>IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.</p>

<p>This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. You will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving <a href="https://github.com/jon-torres/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/tree/main/data_collection_wrangling_notebooks">data collection</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jon-torres/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/tree/main/data_collection_wrangling_notebooks">data wrangling</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jon-torres/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/tree/main/exploratory_analysis_notebooks">exploratory data analysis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jon-torres/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/exploratory_analysis_notebooks/jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb">data visualization"</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jon-torres/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/tree/main/machine_learning_prediction_notebooks">model development</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jon-torres/IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone/tree/main/machine_learning_prediction_notebooks">model evaluation</a>, and reporting your results to stakeholders. You are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.</p>

<h2>Business problem</h2>
<p>SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.</li>
  <li>Explore the data in order to obtain more insights.</li>
</ul>
